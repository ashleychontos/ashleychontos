### Oh, hello.
I am a nontraditional first-gen PhD student at the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa. I use she/her pronouns and oh yeah, hire me! 
- thinks and [writes](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22chontos%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) about many things stars & planets 
- but [tweets](https://twitter.com/ashleychontos?lang=en) about cats and mostly nonsensical things
- and prefers to wrestle with my keyboard for coding (over writing, shh don't tell my advisor).
- oh yeah, and this is my [website](https://ashleyin.space).
