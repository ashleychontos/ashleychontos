### hi there!

My name is Ashley and I am currently wrapping up my PhD at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. My thesis work uses space photometry data from the NASA *Kepler* and TESS missions to learn cool new things about stars & planets. 

I am currently transitioning to my first postdoc position within the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University as a Henry Norris Russell fellow, where I will continue to do independent research in stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science.

#### current science stuff

- TESS-Keck Survey == very large collaboration == lots of fun, exciting science (using HIRES and soon KPF!!)
- Publishing a homogeneous catalog of 22 TESS(-Keck) subgiant planetary systems, including implications for post-main-sequence star/planet evolution
- Developing and testing open-source asteroseismology software for the broader astronomy community to use on current and forthcoming TESS data (called ``pySYD``, peep [here](https://pysyd.readthedocs.io))

#### other random bits

- I am a nontraditional first-generation student and had an entirely different career in my 20s
- I mostly like to think and [write](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22chontos%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) about things related to stars & planets (but definitely more thinking than writing)
- sometimes I [tweet](https://twitter.com/ashleychontos?lang=en) about science but really it's just a front for lots of cat pictures and other nonsensical things
- I am a huge fan of pretty plots and will go to the ends of the Earth to make them
- I have a [website](https://ashleyin.space) but cannot guarantee that it's been updated any time recently
