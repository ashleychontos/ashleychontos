### hi there!

I received a Ph.D. in astronomy from Hawai'i in 2022 working with Dan Huber on many things related to stars & planets. Currently I am working as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton, where I will continue to use a combination of space photometry and ground-based spectroscopy to learn more about planets and the stars they orbit.
