### hi there!

My name is Ashley and I am currently wrapping up my PhD at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai'i at MƒÅnoa. My thesis work uses space photometry data from the NASA *Kepler* and TESS missions to learn cool new things about stars & planets. In fact, I will be live-streaming my defense on July 18th, 2022 at 9am HST in case this sounds like something you would be interested in.

After that, I'll be heading back to the mainland to join the A-MAZING astro department at Princeton this fall (2022) as a Henry Norris Russell (postdoctoral) fellow and I could not be more excited -- so many brilliant theorists to complement my observational-heavy background.

#### current science stuff

- TESS-Keck Survey == very large collaboration == lots of fun, exciting science (using HIRES and soon KPF!!)
- Publishing a homogeneous catalog of 22 TESS(-Keck) subgiant planetary systems, including implications for post-main-sequence star/planet evolution
- Developing and testing open-source asteroseismology software for the broader astronomy community to use on current and forthcoming TESS data (called ``pySYD``, peep [here](https://pysyd.readthedocs.io))

#### other random things (complete with commentary)

- I am a nontraditional first-generation student and had an entirely different career in my 20s (like, *really* different)
- I did not even know what a "physics" was until I had to take it for engineering in my first attempt at college (this is my second)
- I played in the World Series of Poker in 2012 & 2013 (still love me a good game)
- I mostly like to think and [write](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=%20author%3A%22chontos%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) about things related to stars & planets (definitely more thinking than writing)
- sometimes I [tweet](https://twitter.com/ashleychontos?lang=en) about science but really it's just a front for lots of cat pictures and other nonsensical things (so don't fall for it)
- I am a huge fan of pretty plots and will go to the ends of the Earth to make them (even if it means making collaborator figures from scratch myself)
- I have a [website](https://ashleyin.space) but cannot guarantee that it's been updated any time recently (probably not since job applications lol)
