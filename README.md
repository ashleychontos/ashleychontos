### hi there!

I recently received my Ph.D. in astronomy working with Dan Huber on many things related to stars & planets. Currently I am transitioning to my first postdoc position at Princeton, where I will continue to do independent research in both stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science.

#### currently:

- investigating post-main-sequence star/planet evolution using a homogeneous sample of 22 TESS subgiant systems, which is the largest dedicated (homogeneous) survey to date for studying planets orbiting subgiant stars [â†’ and is a major component of my PhD thesis]
- science-ing and observing in support of the California Planet Search and TESS-Keck Survey collaborations
- developing open-source asteroseismology software for the broader astronomy community i.e. ``pySYD`` (peep [here](https://pysyd.readthedocs.io))
