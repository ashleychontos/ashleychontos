Hi there! I am currently a researcher at Dartmouth College interested in all things stars & planets.

Much of my work makes use of photometric data from the NASA Kepler, K2 & TESS missions to characterize stars and planets.

I also...
 - love to develop software tools to make complex topics more accessible 
 - am a huge fan of time series data and data engineering
 - am the momther to several plants and plan(e)ts
